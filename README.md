# HTMX version not NotWashingtonPost application

This is the HTMX version to accompany the [TypeScript](https://github.com/penkar/notWapoTSX), [React](https://github.com/penkar/notwashingtonpost) and [ClojureScript](https://github.com/penkar/notwapo-cljs) application of the same content.

### How to run:

```
git clone git@github.com:penkar/NotWapoHTMX.git
cd NotWapoHTMX
npm install
npm run start
```

The front end application includes the HTMX cdn and 11 lines of JS to open the menu toggle.

All other content and changes are generated by the Express backend rendered content.
